# Default Variable Alias

On this project we use the nomenclatures listed below. They can be found on `/source/types.hpp`. 

```
typedef unsigned char u8;
typedef signed char s8;
typedef char char_type;

typedef unsigned short int u16;
typedef signed short int s16;

typedef unsigned int u32;
typedef signed int s32;

typedef float f32;
typedef double f64;
```

The letter `u` means `unsigned` while `s` means `signed`. In general, the number following the letter indicates the number of bits it occupies. For example `s16` is `signed short`.
