## Contribute to decompiling process

You may need:

* IDA 9.1

### Getting started with decomp

* [Markers](general/markers.md) - How we differ between stubbed functions and matched ones.
* [Repository folders](general/repo_folders.md) - Get acquainted with the project folders.
* [Variable types](general/types.md) - See what typedefs we use on this project.
* [Globals declare](general/globals.md) - How we define globals on GTA2 and how they work.

## Important classes to learn

* [Fix16](classes/fix16.md) - This is how the game avoids using floating numbers (except when really needed).
* [Ang16](classes/ang16.md) - Kind of "Fix16" but for angles. They are fixed point but with less precision.
